A collection of games and utils for boring CS lessons!


## Installation

The installation is... non existant! Its plug-and-play, mostly...

```bash
Download the needed file (sometimes the file itself needs another folder or file to function properly, so be careful with that)
Double-click It
Tadaaaaaaaaa! Its ready!
```
